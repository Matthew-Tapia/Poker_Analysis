This program, written in C++ using the SFML graphics library is built to simulate and display the result of 5 million hands of poker, showing the experimental odds of drawing a specific poker hand given a standard deck of 52 cards and under the assumption that you are also "playing" with four other individuals.

This project utilizes object oriented programming principles as well as C++ file seperation strategies in order to keep the flow of the project efficient, tidy, and organized.
